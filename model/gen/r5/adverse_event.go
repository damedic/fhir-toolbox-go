// An event (i.e. any change to current patient status) that may be related to unintended effects on a patient or research participant. The unintended effects may require additional monitoring, treatment, hospitalization, or may result in death. The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research trial management.  Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients, caregivers or by medical products manufacturers.  Given the differences between these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource. The implementation guides include specific extensions, value sets and constraints.
type AdverseEvent struct {
	// The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
	Id *Id
	// The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
	Meta *Meta
	// A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
	ImplicitRules *Uri
	// The base language in which the resource is written.
	Language *Code
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
