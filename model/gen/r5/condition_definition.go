	Experimental *Boolean
	// The date  (and optionally time) when the condition definition was last significantly changed. The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the condition definition changes.
	Date *DateTime

	Description *Markdown
	// The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts that are listed.
