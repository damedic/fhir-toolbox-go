// A reference to a document of any kind for any purpose.

The DocumentReference resource provides metadata about the document so that the document can be discovered and managed.  The actual content may be inline base64 encoded data or provided by direct reference.

	Meta *Meta

	ImplicitRules *Uri

	Language *Code
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.

To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions.
