	Meta *Meta

	Language *Code
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
	Text *Narrative
	// These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
	Contained []model.Resource
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions.

	Status *CodeableConcept
	// The date at which the given status became applicable.
	StatusDate *DateTime
	// A total of the complete count of contained items of a particular type/form, independent of sub-packaging or organization. This can be considered as the pack size. This attribute differs from containedItem.amount in that it can give a single aggregated count of all tablet types in a pack, even when these are different manufactured items. For example a pill pack of 21 tablets plus 7 sugar tablets, can be denoted here as '28 tablets'. This attribute is repeatable so that the different item types in one pack type can be counted (e.g. a count of vials and count of syringes). Each repeat must have different units, so that it is clear what the different sets of counted items are, and it is not intended to allow different counts of similar items (e.g. not '2 tubes and 3 tubes'). Repeats are not to be used to represent different pack sizes (e.g. 20 pack vs. 50 pack) - which would be different instances of this resource.
