	Language *Code
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.

	Extension []Extension
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the research element definition is stored on different servers.
	Url *Uri
	// A formal identifier that is used to identify this research element definition when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance.
	Identifier []Identifier
	// The identifier that is used to identify this version of the research element definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the research element definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.
	Version *String
	// A natural language name identifying the research element definition. This name should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as code generation.

	Subtitle *String
	// The status of this research element definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.
	Status Code
	// A Boolean value to indicate that this research element definition is authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used for genuine usage.
	Experimental *Boolean
	// The intended subjects for the ResearchElementDefinition. If this element is not provided, a Patient subject is assumed, but the subject of the ResearchElementDefinition can be anything.
	Subject ResearchElementDefinitionSubject
	// The date  (and optionally time) when the research element definition was published. The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the research element definition changes.

	Description *Markdown

These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate research element definition instances.

	// A legal or geographic region in which the research element definition is intended to be used.
	Jurisdiction []CodeableConcept

	Copyright *Markdown
	// The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

	// The period during which the research element definition content was or is planned to be in active use.
