This is an arbitrary value managed by the activity definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active assets.

	// Indicates how quickly the activity  should be addressed with respect to other requests.
	Priority *Code
	// Set this to true if the definition is to indicate that a particular activity should NOT be performed. If true, this element should be interpreted to reinforce a negative coding. For example NPO as a code with a doNotPerform of true would still indicate to NOT perform the action.
