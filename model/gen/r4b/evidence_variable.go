Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.

	// The identifier that is used to identify this version of the evidence variable when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the evidence variable author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.

	// An explanatory or alternate title for the EvidenceVariable giving additional information about its content.
	Subtitle *String
	// The status of this evidence variable. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.
	Status Code
	// The date  (and optionally time) when the evidence variable was published. The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the evidence variable changes.
	Date *DateTime

	Description *Markdown
