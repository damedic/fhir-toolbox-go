	// The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
	Meta *Meta
	// A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
	ImplicitRules *Uri

	Language *Code
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.

To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions.

	// A unique identifier assigned to this observation.
	Identifier []Identifier
	// A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.  For example, a MedicationRequest may require a patient to have laboratory test performed before  it is dispensed.
	BasedOn []Reference
	// A larger event of which this particular Observation is a component or step.  For example,  an observation as part of a procedure.
	PartOf []Reference
	// The status of the result value.
	Status Code
	// A code that classifies the general type of observation being made.
	Category []CodeableConcept
	// Describes what was observed. Sometimes this is called the observation "name".
	Code CodeableConcept
	// The patient, or group of patients, location, or device this observation is about and into whose record the observation is placed. If the actual focus of the observation is different from the subject (or a sample of, part, or region of the subject), the `focus` element or the `code` itself specifies the actual focus of the observation.
	Subject *Reference
	// The actual focus of an observation when it is not the patient of record representing something or someone associated with the patient such as a spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. For example, fetus observations in a mother's record.  The focus of an observation could also be an existing condition,  an intervention, the subject's diet,  another observation of the subject,  or a body structure such as tumor or implanted device.   An example use case would be using the Observation resource to capture whether the mother is trained to change her child's tracheostomy tube. In this example, the child is the patient of record and the mother is the focus.
	Focus []Reference
	// The healthcare event  (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction) during which this observation is made.
	Encounter *Reference
	// The time or time-period the observed value is asserted as being true. For biological subjects - e.g. human patients - this is usually called the "physiologically relevant time". This is usually either the time of the procedure or of specimen collection, but very often the source of the date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.
	Effective ObservationEffective
	// The date and time this version of the observation was made available to providers, typically after the results have been reviewed and verified.
	Issued *Instant
	// Who was responsible for asserting the observed value as "true".
	Performer []Reference
	// The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value.
	Value ObservationValue
	// Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.
	DataAbsentReason *CodeableConcept
	// A categorical assessment of an observation value.  For example, high, low, normal.
	Interpretation []CodeableConcept
	// Comments about the observation or the results.
	Note []Annotation
	// Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e. the target site).
	BodySite *CodeableConcept
	// Indicates the mechanism used to perform the observation.
	Method *CodeableConcept
	// The specimen that was used when this observation was made.
	Specimen *Reference
	// The device used to generate the observation data.
	Device *Reference
	// Guidance on how to interpret the value by comparison to a normal or recommended range.  Multiple reference ranges are interpreted as an "OR".   In other words, to represent two distinct target populations, two `referenceRange` elements would be used.
	ReferenceRange []ObservationReferenceRange

	HasMember []Reference
	// The target resource that represents a measurement from which this observation value is derived. For example, a calculated anion gap or a fetal measurement based on an ultrasound image.
	DerivedFrom []Reference

Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics observations.
