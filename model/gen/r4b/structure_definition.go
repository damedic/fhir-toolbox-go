	Meta *Meta
	// A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
	ImplicitRules *Uri
	// The base language in which the resource is written.
	Language *Code
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.

This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this structure definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the structure definition is stored on different servers.
	Url Uri
	// A formal identifier that is used to identify this structure definition when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance.
	Identifier []Identifier
	// The identifier that is used to identify this version of the structure definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the structure definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
	Version *String
	// A natural language name identifying the structure definition. This name should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as code generation.

	Publisher *String
	// Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the publisher.
	Contact []ContactDetail

	Description *Markdown
	// The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts that are listed.
